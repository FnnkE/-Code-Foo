## How to use the Discord Bot:
You can either create your own Discord bot through the https://discord.com/developers/ or use a bot I am currently hosting https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969079733956538368&permissions=75840&scope=bot

Use !help to get started.

The bot will print several posts initially. After that, it will only post new articles every 15 minutes from the "News", "Videos", and "Reviews" sections of your website.

As mentioned in my code, this is reverse-engineered code from a different Discord Bot I made for the dining halls at my school. The structure is the same but the web scraping and printing are different. https://github.com/FnnkE/MasonMenu

Sadly, I haven't tested to see if the bot works on more than one server yet. Also, I included commented-out code that would put the image thumbnail and author in the messages but it had bugs. Both problems I have plans to fix but I won't be able to do it before the deadline.
